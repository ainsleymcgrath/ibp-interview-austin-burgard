# Welcome to the IBP Interview!

This is a little music app.

It uses Remix, Tailwind (+ DaisyUI), and SQLite.

There is already a SQLite database populated with [this](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/).

## What the app does now

- List artists
- Link you to an artist detail page that shows their albums



## What we need

- Show actual album detail--the dev who started this only shows the album names
- Add some interesting summary info about the artists' music, leveraging more of what's in the DB.
- Once that's done, anything else you want!
