# Welcome to the IBP Interview!

This is a little music app.

It uses Remix, Tailwind (+ DaisyUI), and SQLite.

There is already a SQLite database populated with [this](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/).

## What the app does now

- List artists
- Link you to an artist detail page that shows their albums

## What we need

The developer who started this quit! They left `???`'s in production code. ðŸ¤¦
Notably, there are missing details in the artist page.

- The genre(s) of each album
- The number of tracks on each album
- The actual list of tracks for each album

## Always more to do...

There are plenty of opportunities for improvement. If you see something, say something! You should leave this app better than you found it.
